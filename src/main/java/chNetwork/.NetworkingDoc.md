# **Checkers Game - Server and Client Code Explanation**

This document explains the `REQUEST_CODES` and `RESPONSE_CODES` enums used in the server-client communication for the Checkers game.

---

## **1. Overview**

In the Checkers game, the communication between the client (player) and the server is handled through request and response codes. These codes are structured as enums to provide clarity and avoid overlap. Each enum represents different types of actions that the client sends to the server (`REQUEST_CODES`) and the responses the server sends back to the client (`RESPONSE_CODES`).

### **Request Codes**
- **Client → Server**: These codes represent actions or requests the client makes, such as moving a piece, joining a game, or sending a message.

### **Response Codes**
- **Server → Client**: These codes represent responses the server sends to the client, confirming the success or failure of the request, along with any updates to the game state.

## **2. Request Codes (`REQUEST_CODES`)**

Request codes are used by the client to send actions or requests to the server. They help the server identify the type of action the client wants to perform.

### **Code Breakdown**

| **Code** | **Action**                      | **Description** |
|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1000     | `CONNECT`                        | Client initiates a connection to the server. |
| 1001     | `DISCONNECT`                     | Client disconnects from the server. |
| 1002     | `PING`                           | Client sends a ping to the server to check connectivity. |
| 1100     | `JOIN_GAME`                      | Client joins a game. |

## **3. Response Codes (`RESPONSE_CODES`)**

Response codes are used by the server to send feedback to the client regarding the outcome of their requests. These codes help the client understand if their action was successful or if there was an error.
